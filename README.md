# Timeline / UE4cpped

A simple VR experience of a virtual road through space, representing Earth's history from beginning to present. There are signs along the road that denote highlights on the Earth history timeline. Examples:

> First oceans formed.
>
> Oxygen first produced.
>
> First cellular life.

The most impactful part of the experience is that only the last couple inches of road represent the arrival of primates, and the last few millimeters represents the arrival of the human species.
